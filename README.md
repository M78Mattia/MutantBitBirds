# MutantBitBirds
Solidity Contract for mintable NFTs having on-chain 'mutable' DNA traits

Experiment based on excellent Daibiri work!
https://github.com/nft-fun

Copy, past and compile MutantBitBirds.sol on Remix
https://remix.ethereum.org/ (enable optimization 200)

This is a first draft of a mintable NFT with on-chain traits.

First dynamic svg MutantBitBird is actually flying on testnet !

Now developing: Tokenomics 

No need to stake, earn MCS on first mint and much more simply owning one or more MBB as holder.
The more you own, the more you earn.
Spend earned MCS tokens to 'evolve' yours MBB NFTs (change the on-chain traits)

First yield token implementation deployed on groeli testnet at:
